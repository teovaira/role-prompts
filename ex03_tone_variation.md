## Objective
Control tone and style with explicit instructions.

I will write two prompts - one for friendly tone and one for professional tone.

```
Write an email inviting a candidate to an interview. Use a friendly and warm tone. Make them feel welcome and excited about the opportunity.

Candidate name: Sarah Johnson

```

**Model Output:**

## Comparison

**Similarities (content stays consistent):**
- Both invite Sarah Johnson to interview
- Both mention Junior Developer position
- Both give same date/time/location
- Both ask for confirmation
- Both are polite and respectful

**Differences (tone and style):**

| Aspect | Friendly | Professional |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Greeting | "Hi Sarah!" | "Dear Ms. Johnson," |
| Language | Casual, warm | Formal, precise |
| Emoji | Yes 🎉😊 | No |
| Punctuation | Lots of ! | Minimal exclamation |
| Structure | Conversational flow | Structured sections |
| Length | Longer, more personal | Shorter, more concise |
| Closing | "Best," with emoji | "Sincerely," with full title |
| Flexibility | "no worries at all" | "as soon as possible" |

**What I noticed:**
The friendly version feels like talking to a friend who happens to be hiring. The professional version feels like official business communication. Both are appropriate but for different company cultures. A startup might use friendly, a law firm would use professional.

---

## Conclusion

Tone instructions work really well. The AI kept all the important information the same but completely changed how it sounds. The friendly version makes you feel excited and welcome. The professional version makes you feel respected and taken seriously. Both achieve the goal of inviting someone to interview but create very different impressions.

This shows that tone control is powerful - you can adjust how your message feels without changing what it says. Important for different situations and audiences.
